**ReadMe is a WIP!**

This project is divided between 3 repos. 

wishlist-ts is the frontend 

wishlist-be is the main backend

wishlist-be-py is the webscraping aprt of the backend 


Tasks to be implemented on different repos: 
(mostly to keep track of what I need to do)
- wishlist-py => scrapes, sends data to be
- wishlist-be => upon receiving a request, be checks if a similar research has been made, if it is, sends saved results, if not scrapes and saves to db
